* 42% of of lost customers(churned customers) only stayed with us for less than 6 months.
* key drivers of customer churn are : Month-to-month contract, no offers or offer E, No Premium Tech Support and Fiber Optic internet.

* Improve on loyalty offers or promotions, make offers other than offer E since 16% of churned customers left because they received better offers from the competetion.
* Research customer devices and make one that are the same or better since we lost clients because they felt the competietion had better devices.
